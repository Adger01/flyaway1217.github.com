The following appeared in an article written by Dr.Karp, an anthropologist.

"Twenty years ago, Dr.Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Teria and conculded from his obervations that children in Teria were reared by an entile vilage rather than by their own biological parents. However, my recent intervirews with children living in group of islands that includes Teria show that these children spend much more time talking about their biological parent than about other adults in the vilage. This research of mine proves that Dr.Field's conclusion about Tertian village  culture is invaild and thus that the observation-centered approach to studying cultures is invaild as well. The interview-centered method that my team of graduate students is currently using in Tertia will establish a much more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions there and in other island cultures."

Write a reponse in which you disscuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.
