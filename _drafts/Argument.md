While it is true that the Bugle has more readers and lower price, this is not a cogent reason to reduce the Mercury's price to attract more readers. Considering that more reasons may lied behind the fact of losing readers, for example, the quality of articles of the newspapers or the subject of the newspapers, there is no convincing evidence that lower price can lead to the increase of readers. Unless we can analysis the reasons of losing readers more detailedly and roundly, it is not wise to reduce the price bindly.

Additionally, the author implies that the more readers of a newspapers, the more businesses to buy advertising sapce in the parper may be not correct. The circulation of a newspapers may be a prime reason that the companies considered to choose newspapers to advertise on, but it is not the only reason. For example, if the theme of the newspapers is sport, the Microsoft will never advertise on it, no matter how large the circulation is, beacuse the readers are interested in the sport not the IT. As a conquenece, the number readers may have less impact on advertisement than the author thought. Regardless of the circulation is small or large, there is no strong connection between circulation and advertisement.
