# The old man and the sea

---------------------------

Author: [Ernest Miller Hemingway][]


This is my third time to read this novel, which still impressed me a lot.
The sentence "A man can be destroyed but not defeated" has been accompanying me since the first time I read it, which should be traced back to primary schools.

This time, it only took me 2 to 3 days to finish reading.
During this time period, I enjoyed the most famous fishing fight again.

Among the lots of different explanations about this story, I think I prefer the fighting spirit explanation.
Although Santiago got nothing for his battle with a large marlin, he shows us what a real man should be and what a real battle is.

This story is simply but meaningful.

Maybe one day I will it for the forth time.
