The statement said the culture and history of a society lie in the major cities, we can understand more about the society by studying them. Actually, the major cities do have more population and resources than other small cities. Just in a few days in major cities, you can feel the special characteristic of the local society. Image you live in Beijing for days, you can visit the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and talk to people in Beijing to learn the culture and history. From the history, you can learn the robbery of The Old Summer Palace, the attack committed by the Eight-Nation Alliance which all reflect the sufferings of Chinese people, the sufferings shaped into today's China. These monuments and historical events are the part of the characteristic of Chinese society. 

The statement tell us if we want to understand a society, the major cities are the most important subjects of studying. The potential assumption is that the major cities contains the most important culture and histories. One may argue that the other small cities contain histories too, these histories and culture ,however, are not representative. The major cities have more population , thus, its culture can effect most people in the society and become the mainstream culture. The major cities are more representative to the society.

However, the characteristic of a society is not just about histories. The characteristic of a society is always in change and development. In nowadays society, the small cities are developing in high speed and the high speed development can develop new cultures. For example, in the Silicon Valley, the entrepreneurship is everywhere and it attracts more and more young people to go there to begin their business. Free and efforts become the new characteristic of the Silicon Valley. Similarly, the same phenomenon happens in Hangzhou in China, lots of young people come to Hangzhou to seek opportunities to start their business. This new culture is affecting more and more people and have more and more important role in this society. Although the major cities have traditional and mainstream culture, we just can not ignore the new culture in small cities which also can reflect the characteristic of the society.

In contrast to the statement, studying the small cities can also help people learn more about the characteristic of a society. The population of small cities are increasing which can also increase the effect of new culture. Because of the low cost, more and more elite choose to begin their business in small cities instead of the major cities which result in more workers to come to small cities, especially the IT industry. This phenomenon accelerate the spread of the new culture mentioned above, increasing the influence of new culture. The small cities are becoming more and more important in the characteristic of a society.

The major cities have the mainstream culture of the society while the small cities have new culture, we can not evaluate a society's characteristic by studying just one of them. Given the history of the human race, the culture and characteristic of a society is always changing, there are always mainstream and new culture for us to study. Only when we study both of the major and small cities, can we understand the characteristic of a society.
